## 3) Core Problem / JTBD

When individuals or businesses face legal challenges or need legal services, they seek qualified attorneys who specialize in their specific issue and can be trusted with sensitive matters. Without a professional web presence, potential clients struggle to evaluate a firm's expertise, understand service offerings, assess team credentials, or initiate contact conveniently. Many law firms either lack websites entirely, rely on outdated designs that undermine credibility, or have sites that fail to communicate specializations clearly—resulting in missed client opportunities and inefficient inquiry processes.
